据说如果没有人为定义移动构造函数,但有定义拷贝构造函数,push_back则会优先调用拷贝构造函数

总结:
1. case0的方式最高效, 只需要原地构造到vector中
2. case5,9的方式(push_back传入右值)只需要移动构造, 效率次于case0, [参考stl源码](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/213853588#:~:text=/**%0A%20*%20%20%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8B%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%8F%E6%9D%A5%E8%87%AA,move(__x))%3B%0A%7D%0A%23endif)
3. case6,8的方式很低效(push_back传入左值效率低), 避免使用, 如果非得这样,可以用emplace_back传入左值替代
4. case1和case3对比说明:emplace_back传入左值, 会调用拷贝构造函数; emplace_back传入右值, 会调用移动构造函数
